# Pomodoro Timer

This Pomodoro Timer is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you stay focused and productive using the Pomodoro Technique.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," named after the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## Features
- Set a custom timer for your work sessions (pomodoros) and breaks.
- Start, pause, and reset the timer as needed.
- Visual and audio notifications to signal the end of each session.
- Keep track of your progress with a session log.

## How to Use
1. **Set the Timer:** Use the input fields to set the duration of your work session (pomodoro) and break. The default values are 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for a break.
2. **Start the Timer:** Click the "Start" button to begin the timer countdown.
3. **Pause and Reset:** Use the "Pause" button to temporarily stop the timer and the "Reset" button to start over.
